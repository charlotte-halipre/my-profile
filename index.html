        <h1>Hello, I'm Charlotte :)</h1>
        <img src="images/profile-picture.png" alt="Charlotte image" id="profile-picture">
        <p>I am passionate about foreign cultures, I love meeting new people through my travels. I really like getting out of the house to do new things, since I hate doing nothing and being bored. I'm always looking for new adventures, each one crazier than the last.</p>

        <h2>SPORT ‚öΩÔ∏èüéæ</h2>
        <p>I am in love with sport. Since I was little, I have always loved playing sports and discovering new ones. I currently play tennis and football, but if I could, I would do many others. I have already tried many other sports like volleyball, badminton, swimming... and I love them all. I am sporty by nature, and even when I don't have any equipment available, I always find a way to be active, for example by going for a run outside, walking my dog, or even doing sports at home.</p>

        <h2>MUSIC üéß</h2>
        <p>I've loved music since I was little. I listen to a lot of different styles and I love going to concerts or festivals. I love summer since that‚Äôs when most festivals take place. For example, this summer I went to the ‚ÄúMainsquare‚Äù in Arras and the ‚ÄúPleinAir Festival‚Äù in Douai. I also recently attended concerts by Lomepal and James Baker, two artists I really like.</p>

        <h2>FRIENDS üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>I love my friends and spending time with them. Over time, some have become like family and I love spending time with them even if we don't do anything in particular. I also like meeting new people and making new friends, like this year since starting a new school makes me meet a lot of new people. The only downside to this change is that I see less of my high school friends, with whom I spent all my days. In short, I am sociable by nature and I like spending time with people, whether very well or not so well, who I get to know.</p>
